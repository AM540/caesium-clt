Requirements
==================
CaesiumCLT is based on libcaesium (https://github.com/Lymphatus/libcaesium) and requires it to be compiled.
Please refer to its own documentation.

Basic Installation
==================

   You should be able to compile this software the standard way.
Unpack the archive (if not cloned from GIT), enter the directory
and compile the program.
The sequence should be something like:

	$ tar xfv caesium-clt-*.tar.gz
	$ cd caesium-clt-*
	$ cmake .
	$ make
	$ sudo make install

Cloning from git
==================
	$ git clone https://github.com/Lymphatus/caesium-clt
	$ cd caesium-clt
	$ cmake .
	$ make
	$ sudo make install

You can build out of the source tree in a separate folder. Add this steps before
invoking configure:
	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
Then call:
	$ cmake ..
	$ make
	$ sudo make install
