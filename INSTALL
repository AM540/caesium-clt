Requirements
==================
You will need both mozjpeg and zopflipng compiled as libraries to be able to
compile CaesiumCLT. Refer to their own documentation for the detailed
instructions.


Basic Installation
==================

   You should be able to compile this software the standard way.
Unpack the archive (if not cloned from GIT), enter the directory
and compile the program.
The sequence should be something like:

	$ tar xfv caesiumclt-*.tar.gz
	$ cd caesiumclt-*
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ sudo make install

Cloning from git
==================
	$ git clone https://github.com/Lymphatus/CaesiumCLT
	$ cd CaesiumCLT
	$ autoreconf -fiv
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ sudo make install

You can build out of the source tree in a separate folder. Add this steps before
invoking configure:
	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
Then call:
	$ ../configure
	$ make
	$ sudo make install
